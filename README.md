Drawn Rogues is a rogue-like/Pokemon like where you draw your own creatures. The form and colors of your drawing impact the stats and the gameplay of the creatures.

In the game, drawing is a way to create and evolve creatures. We can also use draws as spells to help in combat or to progress though the map. Draws use colors, and colors are a limited resource.

Instead of capturing pokemon, we capture colors from other creatures.

Drawed rogues has an deep RPG system, with status effect, passives, tons of different stats to have the freedom of creating many different builds.
